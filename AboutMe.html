        Yes that's me ANYWAYS..
        </h3>
        Let me get personal. My father came up with my first and last name but I don't know about my middle names; probably from my mother. I was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York on 1/18/2006 at around 10-11:00 A.M in SUNY Downstate Hospital. Fun fact about me is that my first name is an arabic baby name according to the internet and my father. Besides that, my whole life I've always been fascinated with technology. In this day and age, everywhere you look there will always be a new piece of technology. So if you aren't up to date with the latest tech, then your missing out.
