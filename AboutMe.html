        Now time to get personal. Growing up, I didn't really like my first name because it sounded different from others. And it throws me off sometimes when someone pronounces it wrong. But as I got older I understood, nothing is wrong with being different and it shows. Now that I'm mature enough and at the age where I can take care of myself, I stay completly calm and quiet. I don't react to certain situations with my emotions irrationally anymore, I learned to think before doing something and reevualte any situation I may encounter. I was born and raised in Brooklyn New York on the 18th of January in the year 2006. Fun fact about my first name is that it's an arabic baby name, hence a lot of people ask if I'm muslim.

        My whole life I've always been fascinated and excited everything concerning technology. The way tech has evolved over the years make me so invested in what the future holds. As a kid, I had a desktop to watch random youtube videos, a Wii to play games with, and a Samsung tablet. Now technology is so advanced that there will be the latest iPhone that came out, a new graphics card, another pair of airpods, more products from Apple (I'm a fan of Apple), the list continues. With the world today if you aren't up to date with the latest tech, then your missing out a lot.
