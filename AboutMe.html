        <h3>
        Yes that's me ANYWAYS..
        </h3>
        My FULL name is Kasim Tyrell Nathan Davidson. My father came up with my first and last name but I don't know about my middle names; probably from my mother. I was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York on 1/18/2006 at around 10-11:00 A.M in SUNY Downstate Hospital. Fun fact about me is that my first name is an arabic baby name according to the internet and my father. But besides that, my whole life ive always been fascinated with technology. I always wanted to know things beyond things related to technology and look where I am today, I'm a student at the STEAM Center in Full Stack Development (IT) learning about HTML and CSS. What were currently doing is creating our own personal websites just like this one using what we've learned from HTML and CSS.
