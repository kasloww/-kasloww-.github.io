        Now time to get personal. Growing up, I didn't really like my first name because it was so different from others. But as I got older I began to understand, nothing is wrong with being different and it shows. I even asked my mom once,"Did I ever cry a lot as a baby?" She told me,"No you were a quiet baby." My father came up with my first name and I got my last name also from him. But I don't know anything about my middle names. I was born and raised in Brooklyn New York on the 18th of January in the year of 2006. Fun fact about my first name is that it's an arabic baby name according to the internet.

        My whole life I've always been fascinated and excited about technology. As a kid, I had a desktop to watch random youtube videos, a Wii that belonged to my uncle, and a tablet. Now in this day and age, everywhere you look there will always be a new piece of technology. Wether it be the latest iPhone, newest graphics card, another pair of airpods, more products from Apple, I could keep going but you should get the point by now. And it was So if you aren't up to date with the latest tech, then your missing out.
